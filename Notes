The Ruby on Rails Tutorial standardizes on the excellent cloud development environment Cloud9, part of Amazon Web Services (AWS).
 
Three essential components needed to develop web applications: a text editor, a filesystem navigator, and a command-line terminal.

As a general rule, you should refresh the file tree any time files or directories donâ€™t appear as expected.

Rails enforces a separation between the data in the application (such as user information) and the code used to display it, 
which is a common way of structuring a graphical user interface (GUI). Follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern

One time
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com

Each time
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git status
$ git commit -m "Initialize repository"  /keep the change
$ git log
$ git checkout -f  /withdraw the misoperate

Push on Bitbucket
$ git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:BomiaoChen/hello_app.git
$ git push -u origin master

Create a new topic branch by using checkout with the -b flag
$ git checkout -b modify-README
$ git branch
git branch, just lists all the local branches

Commit
$ git commit -a -m "Improve the README file"

Merge
$ git checkout master
$ git merge modify-README

Delete branch
$ git branch -d modify-README

For illustration only; don't do this unless you mess up a branch
$ git checkout -b topic-branch
$ <really mess up the branch>
$ git add -A
$ git commit -a -m "Make major mistake"
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -D topic-branch

if you have added any new files to the project since the last commit, 
you still have to tell Git about them using git add -A first.

All web application repositories should be private by default. 
Such repositories might contain potentially sensitive information such as cryptographic keys or passwords.
It is possible, of course, to arrange for this information to be handled securely (by having Git ignore it, for example), 
but this is error-prone and requires significant expertise.

heroku
$ heroku login
$ git push heroku master
