1. NEED TO BE DEFINED
The browser issues a request for the /users/1/edit URL.
Rails routes /users/1 to the index action in the Users controller.
The index action asks the User model to edit user 1.
The User model pulls user 1 from the database.
The User model returns user 1 to the controller.
The controller captures the user from browser in the @users variable, which is passed to the index 1.
The view uses embedded Ruby to render the page as HTML.
The controller passes the HTML back to the browser.

Micropost was successfully created.
Content: Ruby is said to follow the principle of least astonishment (POLA), 
meaning that the language should behave in such a way as to minimize confusion for experienced users. 
Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, 
by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle 
of least astonishment to the design of Ruby,[83] but nevertheless the phrase has come to be closely associated 
with the Ruby programming language. The phrase has itself been a source of surprise, as novice users may take 
it to mean that Ruby's behaviors try to closely match behaviors familiar from other languages. In a May 2005 
discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that 
because any design choice will be surprising to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. 
If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for those familiar with the standard.
